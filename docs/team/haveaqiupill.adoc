== PROJECT: Cardi Buddy

---

== Overview

*Cardi Buddy (CardiB)* is a flash cards application that allows students to generate their own flash cards and test
themselves through a simple Command Line Interface. It is specially designed for SoC students as a desktop
application as they are generally comfortable with typing.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to insert images into flashcards*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a filter command that allows the user to filter decks via tags.
