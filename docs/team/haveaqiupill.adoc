== PROJECT: Cardi Buddy

---

== Overview

*Cardi Buddy (CardiB)* is a flash cards application that allows students to generate their own flash cards and test
themselves through a simple Command Line Interface. It is specially designed for SoC students as a desktop
application as they are generally comfortable with typing.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to insert images into flashcards*
** What it does: allows the user to add images from their local drive into flashcards.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users are able to include images such as
diagrams to illustrate more complex concepts (such as UML diagrams for CS2103).
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the Model and Logic section of Cardi Buddy.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands such as the add command and the
creation of a new type of object (Imagecard object). In addition, changes were made to the UI in the FlashcardListPanel
to display images in the flashcard.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a filter command that allows the user to filter decks via tags.

* *Minor enhancement*: added an insert image button that shows a popup window for the user to choose the .png and .jpg
files they want to insert into their flashcards.
