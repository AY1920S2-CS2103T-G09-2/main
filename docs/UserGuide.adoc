== Introduction

Cardi Buddy (CardiB) is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app to store their revision materials as flashcards*. More importantly, CardiB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CardiB can help you to store revision materials quickly. The self-testing features will definitely help you to ace your examinations as opposed to traditional ways of revision by re-reading lecture notes. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `cardibuddy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Cardi Buddy.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all decks
* **`add`**`d/CS1101S t/Basics` : adds an empty deck titled `CS1101S` to the Cardi Buddy.
* *`open 1`* : opens the 1st deck shown in the current list
* **`delete deck`**`3` : deletes the 3rd deck shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Application-specific Terminologies*

* *Decks* are the containers that contain the flashcard. A flashcard can only exist in a deck.
* *Flashcards* are cards that contain revision materials, specifically a question and an answer.
* *Statistics* is the numererical, summarized version of your data, based on your test history. Your statistics can serve as a guideline for you to decide which areas you need to work on, and which areas you are familiar with.

*Common Terminologies*

* *File path* specifies the unique location of a file in a file system from the root directory.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add d/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/CS1101S`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `d/TITLE [t/TAG]` can be used as `d/CS1101S t/Basics` or as `d/CS1101S`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Easy`, `t/Easy t/Basics` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/TITLE t/TAG`, `t/TAG d/TITLE` is also acceptable.

*Special Icons*

* :bulb: is used to signal information that is helpful for the users to know.

==== Searching for a deck: `search deck`

Searches for the decks with titles that contain any of the given keywords or all of the keywords
concatenated with the `&` symbol.
Format: `search deck KEYWORD [&] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* If the search has a `&` symbol, only decks with the words concatenated before and after
the symbol will be returned.
* The search is case insensitive. e.g cs2040 will match CS2040
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Science Module will match Module Science
* Only titles of the decks are searched.
* The keyword needs to match a word within the deck’s title exactly . e.g. cs will not match with cs2030

Examples:

* `search deck database` +
Displays decks with the word `database` in the titles.

* `search deck database & relational` +
Displays decks with both of the words `database` and `relational` in the titles.

==== Searching for a card: `search card`

Finds the cards with a question that contain any of the given keywords.
Format: `search card KEYWORD [&] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* A deck needs to be opened for the `search card` command to work. The command will only search for cards in the
opened deck.
* If the search has a `&` symbol, only cards with the words concatenated before and after
the symbol, in the question, will be returned.
* The search is case insensitive. e.g programming will match Programming.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Javascript programming language will match with programming language Javascript.
* The keyword needs to match a word within the question exactly. e.g. Java will not match with Javascript.

Examples:

* `search card principle` +
Displays cards with the word `principle` in the questions.

* `search card diagram & UML` +
Displays decks with both of the words `diagram` and `UML` in the questions.
// end::search[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filtering

==== Filtering by tags: `filter`

Filters across all decks and only displays the decks with the specific tag.
Format: `filter TAGNAME [&] [MORE_TAGNAMES]`

* If the search has a `&` symbol, only decks with the tags concatenated before and after
the symbol will be returned.
* Filtering by tag is case insensitive. e.g hard will match Hard

Examples:

* `filter hard` +
Displays decks with the tag `hard`.

* `filter hard & coremodule` +
Displays decks with both the tags `hard` and `coremodule`.
// end::filter[]

=== Prioritising

Cards that the user has answered wrongly to (user input does not match with answer) is automatically moved to the back of the testing session. The user will be able to reattempt the same flashcard again later in the testing session.

There is no need to prioritise manually.


=== Testing

==== Starting a test session for a deck: `test INDEX`
Replace `INDEX` with the index number of the deck you wish to test, which can be found in the list view of all your decks.

What it does:
* A test session will immediately replace the normal deck and flashcard list view.
* The first question of the test session will be displayed.

Example Usage:

* `test 1` +
Creates a test session for the 1st deck.

==== Answering a question: `ans YOUR ANSWER`
Replace `YOUR ANSWER` with your answer to the displayed question.

What it does:
* Submits your answer, and checks your answer against the flashcard's stored answer
* Displays the result of your answer (CORRECT or WRONG)
* Displays your answer and the flashcard's answer

Example Usage:

* `ans CardiBuddy` +
To answer the question: "What is the name of this application?"

==== Don't want to answer? Use: `skip`

What it does:

* If you already know the answer to the question, and don't want to waste your time answering it, just type `skip` to go to the next question.
* CardiB will not note down this flashcard in your test history, and will merely remove it from your current test session.

==== Force correct an answer: `force`

What it does:

* CardiB takes your answer word for word when checking against the flashcard's model answer.
* If your answer differs by the model answer, it will be marked as wrong.
* After viewing the model answer, if you feel that your answer still captures the gist of what the question wants, you can `force` your answer to be marked as correct.

==== Go to the next question: `next`

What it does:

* After submitting your answer, type `next` to go to the next question (if there are any left to test).
* You can only type `next` once you have submitted your answer.

==== Quit the test session halfway: `quit`

What it does:

* Allows you to quit the current test session even before it is completed.

=== Displaying History

==== Displaying the command history: 'history'

Displays all the commands that has been inputted by the user during the current session.
Format: 'history'

=== Undo/Redo

==== Undoing command: `undo`

Undoes latest command.
Format: `undo`

==== Redoing command: `redo`

Redoes latest command.
Format: `redo`

=== Detecting duplicates

==== Detecting duplicate deck

Upon adding a new deck, the application automatically checks if there are any existing decks with the same title. Only decks with unique titles can be successfully added.

==== Detecting duplicate card

Upon adding a new card to a specific deck, the application automatically checks if there are any existing cards with the same question in that deck. Only cards with unique questions can be successfully added.

If there is a card with the same question but it is in a different deck, the card can still be successfully added.

=== Statistics

* Shows the number of Decks/Cards created and deleted, number of Test Sessions played, average correct percentage, average number of tries for each question.
* Includes a line graph of the history of test previous test results.


==== Displaying all statistics: `statistics`
